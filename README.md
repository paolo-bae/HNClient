# HNClient

A simple **Hacker News reader** for **iOS** built with **SwifUI**.

HNClient displays the new, top and best stories loaded directly from the **official Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API)**.

### Features:
- displays New, Top and Best stories with score and the user that loaded them 
- has pull-to refresh in every list
- you can easily access every article you want

It was made for learning and testing purposes.

### CocoaPods
The CocoaPods implementation was used to try a different dependecy for creating a custom TabView. It was removed to use native TabView. It is actually empty but I will not remove the dependency manager as i wish to improve this Hacker News Client as I can spend more time learning and testing new things in Swift.
